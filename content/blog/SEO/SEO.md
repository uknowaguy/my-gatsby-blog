With under a year to go until I graduate, I've been going through and 
polishing my old web projects that I rushed through (lots of trash I created on 
the web, don't judge). One thing I have noticed, is that I am extremely hard to 
find when my name is searched. Last thing I need is a potential employeer googling 
my name and seeing a guy who's wanted for a serious offense.

###Enter Meta Tags and SEO...

Currently, I'm in a web development course and today we miraculously learned 
about meta tags and search engine optimization (SEO). 

Mind Blown ðŸ¤¯

I'm leaving this Blog short and sweet, because I'm not 100% sure that what I did will 
make me pop-up first when my name is searched, but my fingers are crossed.
