You made it to my page, welcome! 

This is my first experience using Gatsby and Markdown. And I have to say, I'm enjoying my experience. The ease of use is very attractive, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž that launching will be the same.

Curios as to how I built this blog? You're in luck. [I've included the video I used to make it happen.](#abcd) The requirements are minimal and not a lot of programming experience is needed. 

Let's go over some basic requirements.
- Desire to blog
- Computer
- Internet

Of course, you'll need some tools on your computer to make your blog a reality. Here's a list of tools with links to help assist you on your journey.
1. Code editor [(I'm using Visual Studio code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) 
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 
- [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) 
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/)

**If you need more detailed instructions you can go to [Gatsby's Tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/) for help.** 

Now, it's magic time! Let's... 
Open a terminal (Open in vscode for ease of use)

From here, we'll run the following command
```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

In your terminal, lets make a folder and move into it.
```bash
mkdir gastby
cd gastby
```
Now we'll run
```bash
gatsby new gatsby-starter-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```
Move into gatsby-starter-blog
```bash
cd gatsby-starter-blog
```
Followed by
```bash
gatsby develop
```

And just like that, you now have a Blog! Definitely watch the video to figure out what's what.
