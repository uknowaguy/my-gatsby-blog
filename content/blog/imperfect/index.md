## Perfect Imperfection

Forgot I had a blog to take care of, it's ben a minute sense I last wrote. Maybe that's what 
brought me to this ***perfect time*** to write.

***2020 Tried To Keel*** 

The year of Covid has passed with a toll that steadily rises. Some of us let it takes us out, but those of us that are off keel
slipped through to 2021. (Yes I believe in Corona and belive it is a very serious disease. I'm not making fun of its seriousness 
or those that have passed from it) Thought I should throw that in there for an example of how to not take this blog literal. There
is no need to get but hurt ðŸ˜Ž

### Rehabilation & Rehabilitation
    

There was once a time when I was unwillingly ready to be rehabilitated. It wasn't the best time of my life, but it was perfectly timed. 
I did a lot of soul searching, poetry (from my flowing tree), and started to learn to hack myself. Those tough times created this person that sits behind (or in front of ... depends on which way you view up) my keyboard. 

Early this morning I was washing dishes, this doesn't happen often... lol. Saw the flashes of light reflecting on the tide that brings in the life/water. Those flashes caused me to reflect on my past and how I've ben my biggest critic. I've held myself back, time and time again. Excuses I create
and I'm sure you can relate. I related to all those thougths and thought about a poem I wrote: Perfectly Perfect... Or something like that. My therapist remembers, because I'd read them to her so I could feel heard. 

That's all we want, right? To be heard? To be listened to? 

***CrookedNose ChippedTooth UnevenHead***

My thoughts have always ben scattered. At times I call myself, a Scattered Brain Atheist. It can be difficult to articulate words that can relate to 
those who don't have this symptom. Feelings of, my brain/thoughts don't matter, or my ideas are shit; constantly run through my head. From a 
10th grade dropout (after taking it 3 times) to an almost 40 year old college student anout to graduate. I've realized my english writing is not 
perfect, but my Brain Matters. My thoughts and your thoughts matter. 

### Do Not Let Them Tell You It is Not Okay To Be Imperfect

Kinda funny how today is called, the present. Todays a gift and guess what? Chicken Butt ... JK ... Todays perfect. Yours and mines imperfections
are what makes us Perfectly Relateable. That is why we follow each other. Comfort from others Comforts us.
